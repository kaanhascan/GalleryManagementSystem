# GallerySQL

This is a basic C# application to help the user with the operations via user interface

# If you want to try it on your own

You just need to execute the script which is provided in the program files
And then find your local name from SQL Editor 
Then you just have to change the connection name to it 
SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(#YOURNAMEHERE);

And you're all set enjoy :)
